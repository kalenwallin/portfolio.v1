                    Hello everyone! My name is Kalen Wallin. I'm a junior computer science student in the honors program
                    at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL). I like coding and challenging myself with new projects. I work
                    on a wide range of personal projects, everything from websites to video games to mobile apps. When I'm not working on
                    projects, I like to lift weights, play video games, or watch movies/tv. I also invest in and trade cryptocurrencies.
                    I'm almost always listening to music with my favorite genres being hip-hop, pop, and electronic.
                    I enjoy helping others and serving the community. 
                    I've completed over 100 hours of community service and I'm always on standby for new opportunities.
                </p>
