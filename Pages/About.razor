                Kalen Wallin is a computer science student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) currently
                in his fourth year and in the honors program. He had the opportunity to study abroad in Iceland
                for a semester at Reykjavik University (RU) during his third year.
                <br /> <br />
                His love for web development began in elementary school, where he took an online course in
                HTML and CSS at Codecademy. However, it wasn't until he began his studies at UNL that he
                discovered the intricacies of programming languages beyond the basics of HTML and CSS.
                <br /> <br />
                He has refined these skills through countless courses and personal projects,
                as well as an internship. His internship was with FarmAfield, an online marketplace
                for ownership investments, where he developed websites using the Django tech stack.
                <br /> <br />
                Kalen also has experience with game development and graphic design through courses
                and extracurricular activities at UNL, RU, and Chase County Schools (CCS). He honed
                his skills in game development, starting with the creation of "Fappy Borbs" in high
                school, followed by "Minieval" during his second year of undergraduate studies, and
                currently collaborating with Mystic Rhoads Productions on his third project "baldorf".
                <br /> <br />
                With a keen attention to detail and a focus on the bigger picture, Kalen is an
                organized and thoughtful individual who consistently delivers results. He works
                well in teams and ensures all team members can contribute effectively to ensure
                stable progress. Raised by a family of farmers, he was taught to take the initiative
                and get things done.
                <br /> <br />
                Kalen plans to graduate from UNL in August 2023 and is actively seeking employment as
                a full-stack web developer. Send him an email or message him on
                LinkedIn if you're interested.
