# Welcome to the personal portfolio of Kalen Wallin!

I created this website using Blazor WebAssembly which is a part the .NET Framework and Visual Studio IDE. Blazor uses HTML and CSS as well as C# instead of Javascript.

I am hosting this website using GitHub Pages.

## v1.1 Changes:
- Added Dark mode
- Animated elements on page load
- Added recent work experience and development projects
- Updated some of the images to have transparent background instead of white, to look good with Dark mode.
- Updated my about page.
- Resized some cards to make them look less goofy. (all cards were the same size before, so there were some with a lot of empty space)
